# Deep Learning Forecasts Sleep Apnea from Single-lead ECG

In this project, we implemented convolutional neural network (CNN), long short-term memory (LSTM) and artificial neural network (ANN) for forecasting sleep
apnea events before occurrence. 

Here, we used PhysioNet ECG Database which is available in: https://physionet.org/content/apnea-ecg/1.0.0/ 


Firstly, we extracted R-R Intervals and R-peak amplitude and then fed to ANN and deep learning methods.

During this project, we used different slow time for sleep apnea forecasting in 1-5 min in the future.

CNN-5, LSTM-5: Slow time = 5min

CNN-10, LSTM-10: Slow time = 10 min

CNN-20, LSTM-20: Slow time = 20 min

We used some special pre-processing for this project: 1- labeling data based on our target, 2- Based on slow time we removed begining intervals for example when we used 5-min for slow time, we should remove ECG intervals 1-5 and so on. 3- Based on time of forecasting we removed ending intervals, for example when we predicted 5-min ahead, we should remove 5-min of ending ECG intervals and so on.
